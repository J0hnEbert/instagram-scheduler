# Instagram Scheduler

A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to schedule Instagram posts using [instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi). The app demonstrates user authentication, scheduling of image and video posts, and placeholder caption/hashtag generation via a local generative AI model.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the application locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Note

This project uses placeholder functions for image and text generation. Integrating a real local GenAI model requires additional setup.
